# Multi-Channel-Acoustic-Echo-Cancellation

Collected real-time voice data samples in two different scenarios one with a single microphone and the other with a dual microphone.


Performed ICA based technique(kurtosis) using the maximization of non- gaussianity to cancel the echo in both the situations.


Acquired an ERLE above 35db in both the scenarios which follows the ITU-T standards and is efficient.
